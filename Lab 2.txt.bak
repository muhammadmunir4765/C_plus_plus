//LAB2 by MUNIR SOOMRO OR MUHAMMAD MUNIR 

//Activity 1:	Write a C++ program that asks user to input two integer values and then performs the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
//division on those values. Something like shown below:

//Sample OUTPUT
//Enter your first number : 8
//Enter your second number : 4
//Addition is : 12
//Sutraction is : 4
//Multiplication is : 32
//Division is : 2

//Solution 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std; 
int main(){
	 
	int var1,var2;
	int sum,minus,multi,div;
	
	cout<<"Enter your first number : ";
	cin>>var1; //save value in var1 
	cout<<"Enter your second number : ";
	cin>>var2;	//save value n var2
	
	//Now 
	sum=var1+var2;
	cout<<"Addition is : "<<sum<<endl;
	minus=var1-var2;
	cout<<"Sutraction is : "<<minus<<endl;
	multi=var1*var2;
	cout<<"Multiplication is : "<<multi<<endl;
	div=var1/var2;
	cout<<"Division is : "<<div<<endl;
	
	
	return 0; 
}



//Activity 2:	Make some changes in the program written in the Activity 1 so that the output should be like the following

//Sample OUTPUT
//Enter your first number : 12
//Enter your second number : 4
//Addition of 12 and 4 is : 16
//Sutraction of 12 and 4 is : 8
//Multiplication of 12 and 4 is : 48
//Division of 12 and 4 is : 3

	cin>>var1; //save value in var1 
	cout<<"Enter your second number : ";
	cin>>var2;	//save value n var2
	
	//Now 
	sum=var1+var2;
	cout<<"Addition of "<<var1<<" and "<<var2<<" is : "<<sum<<endl;
	minus=var1-var2;
	cout<<"Sutraction of "<<var1<<" and "<<var2<<" is : "<<minus<<endl;
	multi=var1*var2;
	cout<<"Multiplication of "<<var1<<" and "<<var2<<" is : "<<multi<<endl;
	div=var1/var2;
	cout<<"Division of "<<var1<<" and "<< var2<<" is : "<<div<<endl;

//Activity 3:	The formula for converting the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit is as follows. 
//Formula : F=((9/5)*C)+32
//Now, write a C++ program that asks users to input a temperature in Celsius.
//Then, your program should convert that temperature to Fahrenheit (according to the formula given above) and display the converted temperature on the screen.

	float temp_in_frnh;
	
	cout<<"Enter temperature in celcius : ";

	temp_in_frnh=((9*temp_in_celc)/5)+32;
	cout<<"Temp in Farnhite is : "<<temp_in_frnh;

}


//Activity 4:	Make some changes in the program written in the Activity 3 to convert the temperature vice versa (I.e., from Fahrenheit to Celsius) according to the following formula
