//Lab 4 by MUNIR SOOMRO OR MUHAMMAD MUNIR 

//Activity 1: Write a C++ program that should ask a user to input a number and then print if that number is odd or even.
//Hint: A number is even if it is fully/completely divided by 2. Otherwise, it is odd.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	cout<<"	Even or Odd \n\n";
	
	cout<<"	Entrer Number : ";
	int input;
	cin>>input;
	if((input%20)==0){
		cout<<"\n	Nummber is Even. ";
		
	}
	else {
		cout<<"\n	Number is Odd.";
		
	}
	
	return 0;
}

//Activity 2: Write a C++ program which should ask you to input your name (or username). Then, if that username matches with your name, then it should print “Success”. 
//Otherwise, it should print “Failure”.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	
	cout<<"	Entrer your username : ";
	string input;
	cin>>input;
	if(input=="Munir"){
		cout<<"\n	Succcess ";
		
	}
	else {
		cout<<"\n	Failure";
		
	}
	
	return 0;
}

//Activity 3: Extend the program written in Activity 2. Now, it should also ask to enter a password. If the username is abc and the password is pass123, then it should display “Success”. 
//Otherwise, it should display “Failure”.
//Hint: Here, you have to check for two conditions. One for the username and second for the password.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	
	string password="pass123";
	string username="abc";
	string user_input,pass_input;
	
	cout<<"	Entrer your username : ";
	cin>>user_input;
	cout<<endl;
	
	cout<<"	Enter you password : ";
	cin>>pass_input;
	
	
	
	if(user_input==username && pass_input==password){
		cout<<"\n	Succcess ";
		
	}
	else {
		cout<<"\n	Failure";
		
	}
	
	return 0;
}

//Activity 4: Write a C++ program that should ask a user to enter the 
// Total marks in a semester
// Marks obtained by a student .
//Then, it should compute the percentage of that student according to the obtained marks out of total marks. 
//Finally, it should tell the grade of a student according to the percentage of his/her marks. Details/rules of the grades are given below
// If the percentage is 90 (or more than 90) and less than or equal to 100, then the grade is A1.
// If the percentage is less than 90 but greater than or equal to 80, then the grade is A.
// Similarly, if the percentage is between 70 and 79, then the grade is B.
// If the percentage is between 60 and 69, then the grade is C.
// If the percentage is less than 60, then the student fails and the grade is F
